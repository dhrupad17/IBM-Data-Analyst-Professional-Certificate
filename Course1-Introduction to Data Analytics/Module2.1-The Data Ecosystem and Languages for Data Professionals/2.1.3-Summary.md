## Summary


A **data analyst ecosystem** includes the infrastructure, software, tools, frameworks, and processes used to gather, clean, analyze, mine, and visualize data.

### Based on the structure of the data, it can be categorized as:

- **Structured Data**: Well-organized in formats that can be stored in databases.
- **Semi-Structured Data**: Partially organized and partially free form.
- **Unstructured Data**: Cannot be conventionally organized into rows and columns.

Data comes in a wide variety of file formats, such as delimited text files, spreadsheets, XML, PDF, and JSON, each with its own benefits and limitations.

Data is extracted from multiple sources, including relational and non-relational databases, APIs, web services, data streams, social platforms, and sensor devices.

Once gathered, data is staged in a **data repository** for preparation and analysis. The type, format, and sources of data influence the kind of data repository used.

### Data professionals require a range of languages to extract, prepare, and analyze data:

- **Querying languages**: SQL, used for accessing and manipulating database data.
- **Programming languages**: Python, R, and Java, for developing applications.
- **Shell and Scripting languages**: Unix/Linux Shell, PowerShell, for automating operational tasks.
