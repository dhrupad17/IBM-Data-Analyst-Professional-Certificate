# Data Analytics vs. Data Analysis

The terms **Data Analysis** and **Data Analytics** are often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference between the two. Some argue that these terms mean different things and should not be used interchangeably, though the distinction is technical.

### Definitions:
- **Analysis**: A detailed examination of the elements or structure of something.
- **Analytics**: The systematic computational analysis of data or statistics.

### Key Differences:
- **Analysis**: Can be performed without numerical data (e.g., business analysis, psychoanalysis).
- **Analytics**: Almost always involves the use of data and numerical manipulation, even without the prefix "Data."
  
Some experts claim that:
- **Data Analysis** is used for historical data to draw inferences.
- **Data Analytics** focuses on predicting future performance.
